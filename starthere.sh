# Thoughts after meeting with Jay and Topher

# maybe using google arcore:
# https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/developer-guides/anchors
# https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android

# If I extend this to an android app I'll need:
# https://developer.android.com/studio/

# and three.js
# https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_scene

# maybe a marine gps to get data logged info including heigt information
# maybe using OS maps from OpenStreetMap?
# or the Google Maps Elevation API

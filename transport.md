public transport

once upon a time, Glastonbury had a railway station


"The bus to Bristol is brilliant, every half hour for the most part, every hour in the evening
The conservative/liberal democrat coalition government cuts meant a brief curtailment of  evening services but various events including an injection of EU money mean we now have beautiful double decker leather seated USB charging buses with awesome views. That's the good news"

buses to other places have been reduced to a skeleton service
the direct buses to Castle Cary Railway Station are no more
Direct buses to Bath 
Weekend buses to Taunton
direct buses to Tauntion hospital and Railway station











Living for over a decade without a car has given me the insider knowledge.
